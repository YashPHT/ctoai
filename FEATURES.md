## Demo Files
- `index.html` - Main application (empty state)
- `demo-with-tasks.html` - Demo with sample tasks loaded
- `api-stub.html` - API documentation

## API Integration Notes
The chatbot is designed to work with a backend API at `/api/chat`. When the API is not available, the chatbot enters an offline mode with basic functionality. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Implement POST endpoint at `/api/chat`
2. Follow the request/response format in `api-stub.html`
3. Support multi-step conversation flows
4. Return task objects when tasks are created
5. Optionally include action buttons and motivational messages

## Performance Considerations
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Efficient DOM updates
- LocalStorage for persistence
- Optimized scroll handling
- Minimal reflows/repaints
- CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations where possible
